RAG Notes\n\nA simple note-taking web app featuring retrieval augmented generation (RAG). Notes live only in your browser memory. When you ask a question, your current notes are sent to the server for retrieval and answer generation using OpenAI.\n\nFeatures\n- Add, list, and delete notes (in-memory, no storage).\n- Ask questions; the API performs embedding-based retrieval over your notes and uses a chat model to answer.\n- OPENAI_KEY is read on the server; the key is never exposed to the client.\n\nGetting Started (Local)\n1) Copy .env.example to .env.local and set OPENAI_KEY.\n2) Install deps: npm install\n3) Run dev server: npm run dev\n4) Open http://localhost:3000\n\nDeploying to Vercel\n- Push this repo to GitHub and import into Vercel.\n- In Vercel Project Settings -> Environment Variables, add OPENAI_KEY.\n- Deploy.\n\nNotes\n- This app intentionally does not persist data. Reloading the page clears notes.\n- Retrieval uses text-embedding-3-small and answers are generated with gpt-4o-mini.\n
